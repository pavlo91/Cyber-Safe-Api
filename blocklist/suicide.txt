you’ll be better off when i’m gone
you’ll be better off when i’m not here
no one cares if i’m here
i wish i was dead
you won’t miss me when i die
i won’t bother you anymore when i’m gone
the world would be better off without me
i have nothing to live for
i want to make it all go away
i don’t want to live
kill myself
hurt myself
broke myself
cut myself
shoot myself
stab myself
swallowed pills
